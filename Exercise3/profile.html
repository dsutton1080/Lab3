            Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955 in San Francisco, 
            California. His unwed biological parents, Joanne Schieble and 
            Abdulfattah Jandali, put him up for adoption. Steve was adopted by 
            Paul and Clara Jobs, a lower-middle-class couple, who moved to the 
            suburban city of Mountain View a couple of years later.

            The Santa Clara county, south of the Bay Area, became known as 
            Silicon Valley in the early 1950s after the sprouting of a myriad 
            of semi-conductor companies. As a result, young Steve Jobs grew up 
            in a neighborhood of engineers working on electronics and other 
            gizmos in their garages on weekends. This shaped his interest in 
            the field as he grew up. At age 13, he met one the most important 
            persons in his life: 18-year-old Stephen Wozniak, an electronics 
            wiz kid, and, like Steve, an incorrigible prankster.
